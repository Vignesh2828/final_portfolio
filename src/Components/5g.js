          5G wireless technology is meant to deliver higher multi-Gbps peak data
          speeds, ultra low latency, more reliability, massive network capacity,
          increased availability, and a more uniform user experience to more
          users. Higher performance and improved efficiency empower new user
          experiences and connects new industries Radio technologies have
          evidenced a rapid and multidirectional evolution with the launch of
          the analogue cellular systems in 1980s. Thereafter, digital wireless
          communication systems are consistently on a mission to fulfil the
